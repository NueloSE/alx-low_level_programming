## Function pointers

### General Objectives
-	What are function pointers and how to use them
-	What does a function pointer hold
-	Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory.

### Mandatory Tasks
| Tasks | Descriptions |
| --- | ---|
| 0. | A function that prints a name |
| 1. | A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| 2. | A function that searches for an integer |
| 3. | A program that performs simple operations. |
|  | You are allowed to use the standard library |
|  | Usage: calc num1 operator num2 |
|  | You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int |
|  | operator is one of the following: |
|  | +: addition |
|  | -: subtraction |
|  | *: multiplication* |
|  | /: division |
|  | %: modulo |
|  | The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line |
|  | You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int |
|  | if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98 |
|  | if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99 |
|  | if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100 |
|  | This task requires that you create four different files. |
| 4. | A program that prints the opcodes of its own main function |
